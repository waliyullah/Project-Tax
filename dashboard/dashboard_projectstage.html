      <h2>PROJECT 1: ELEME CRUDE OIL REFINERY</h2>
      <p><strong>PROJECT STATUS: 50% Complete</strong> <br>
      For many years Nigeria has suffered the indignity of being the only top six OPEC Nation without the capacity to refine enough petroleum to satisfy its local consumption. As a result, the nation has endured perennial scarcity of petroleum products for decades, but thankfully, that sad chapter of our national life is about to come to an end with the completion of the ELEME REFINERY. <br>

      Two years ago, the Federal Government of Nigeria initiated this laudable project to build from scratch, a world-class refinery that will output more than enough petrol to satisfy local consumption and save the nation’s blushes. <br>

      If you are asking what makes this project different and more likely to succeed, first, this refinery is located in the heart of the oil producing Niger Delta region which reduces the cost of supplying crude oil to the facility unlike the logistic nightmare that is the Kaduna refinery. <br>

      Also, this administration has signed a 20-year maintenance contract with Siemens, its installation partners, to handle the maintenance of the refinery for the duration of the contract. This move will ensure that the refinery doesn’t fall into a state of disrepair as the other refineries have done. During this period Siemens will train at least 100,000 Nigerians in all the key areas of maintaining the refinery so that Nigerians will take over from them at the expiration of the contract. <br>

      Now at 50% completion, the Federal Government has taken delivery of all the key components for the refinery including the gigantic continuous catalytic regeneration reactor pictured below and is on schedule to complete the project in another two years.
</p>

      <p><strong>Benefits of this project:</strong> 
        <ol>
          <li>
      Employment: An immediate dividend of the Eleme refinery project has been the huge boost it has given to our employment numbers, employing over 100,000 Nigerians in high, medium and low wage categories since the start of the project two years ago. The project is also expected to hire another 100,000 people before completion and another 200,000 on completion to operate the refinery.
          </li>

          <li>
            Ending fuel scarcity: The Eleme refinery is expected to produce 120 million litres of Premium Motor Spirit(PMS) which is twice our daily consumption quota which is currently at 54 million litres. With this amount of PMS being produced daily, the perennial fuel scarcity that has dogged us will never rise again.
          </li>

          <li>
            Plug economic leakage: As soon as the Eleme refinery comes on stream there will be no need to continue the highly wasteful subsidy regime that has frittered away most of our crude oil earnings over the years. This would leave the Federal Government with even more money to spend on other useful capital projects that will impact the lives of Nigerians positively.
          </li>

          <li>
            Boost foreign reserves: Aside from plugging leakages, the Eleme refinery is also optimized to produce various petrochemical by-products from crude oil needed for manufacturing. This will mean even more income for us from the same quantity of oil than we used to earn by just exporting unrefined crude oil.

      <h2>Project 2</h2>
      <p><strong>Overall Impression:</strong>  An elegant, malty German amber lager with a balanced, complementary beechwood smoke character. Toasty-rich malt in aroma and flavor, restrained bitterness, low to high smoke flavor, clean fermentation profile, and an attenuated finish are characteristic.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> A historical specialty of the city of Bamberg, in the Franconian region of Bavaria in Germany. Beechwood-smoked malt is used to make a Märzen-style amber lager. The smoke character of the malt varies by maltster; some breweries produce their own smoked malt (rauchmalz).</p>
    </section>
    <section id="project3" class="tab-panel">
      <h2>Project 3</h2>
      <p><strong>Overall Impression:</strong> A dark, strong, malty German lager beer that emphasizes the malty-rich and somewhat toasty qualities of continental malts without being sweet in the finish.</p>
      <p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Originated in the Northern German city of Einbeck, which was a brewing center and popular exporter in the days of the Hanseatic League (14th to 17th century). Recreated in Munich starting in the 17th century. The name “bock” is based on a corruption of the name “Einbeck” in the Bavarian dialect, and was thus only used after the beer came to Munich. “Bock” also means “Ram” in German, and is often used in logos and advertisements.</p>

      <h2>PROJECT 5: FARMit – MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE</h2>
      <p><strong>PROJECT STATUS: 0%</strong> <br>
        Food self-sufficiency is a matter of National security as it is dangerous for any nation to be dependent on others to feed its own population. This is why the Buhari led Federal Government has set up FARMit with a clear mandate to ensure that Nigeria is self-sufficient in food production by the end of his second term. <br>

        FARMit is a technology driven project under the Ministry of Agriculture that aims to use its state-of-the-art AI research capabilities to significantly boost food production and availability. With their data driven techniques, FARMit will pass the knowledge gleaned from their research on to farmers educating them about threats, opportunities and better farm practices for greater yield. <br>

        Also, given that most of our agricultural produce is lost before it gets to the market due t poor storage facilities, FARMit will also build and manage strategically located, world-class storage facilities around the country, including silos and cold rooms to ensure that we reduce food loss to the barest minimum.

      </p>

      <p><strong>Benefits of the project</strong> 
      <ol>
        <li>
          Food security: The FARMit project will go a long way in increasing the quantity and availability of the most widely consumed staple foods in Nigeria and make us less dependent on foreign governments for our sustenance. Eventually, we shall become food secure.
        </li>
        <li>
          Poverty reduction: It is estimated that most Nigerians spend over 50% of household income on food primarily because of high food prices caused by importation. The increased food production and better preservation facilities that would be brought on stream with FARMit will significantly improve food availability and drive the price of food downwards thereby making the average Nigerian richer as they spend less on food.
        </li>
        <li>
          Employment: FARMit is expected to directly employ 100,000 Nigerians within its first two years of operation and indirectly employ another 200,000 farmers. This will go a long way in addressing the rising unemployment among our teeming youth population.
        </li>
        <li>
          Export: With increased efficiency in food production and storage as a result of the activities of FARMit, soon we will become net exporters of key food items to our neighbours and the rest of the world. The foreign exchange earned from exporting food will then be committed to other pressing infrastructural projects to make life better for Nigerians.
